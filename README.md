# Pi-Trainer
A muscle-memory python script to remember digits of pi.

## Installation
### Windows
It uses curses for ui, so on windows you will need to install `windows-curses`
```
pip3 install windows-curses
```
### Android
This can also run within Termux, preferably installed through F-Droid
I recommend the PC-Numpad (not yet on appstores, build yourself) extension for AnySoftKeyboard, to build up that muscle memory.
